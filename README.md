a) The server framework which is used to develop this application was “node.js”. It means people see value in creating modules for it
that are highly plausible is a lot easier than creating a Ruby GEM. However both Ruby and node.js come close to each other in 
terms of popularity.

b) The client framework which is used to develop this application was “JQUERY”. The main thing which can get impressed with 
Query is any complex code can be concluded in a single line of code and is a modular set of ross-browser methods for making
AJAX requests. 

c) Deploying my site in Heroku server troubled me a bit more. It gave me more authentication problems while I changed the 
project name. Moreover, the commands to clone my code to Heroku made me to put some effort. However, this got solved by 
fixing some bugs in my Mac OS X terminal. 

d) The client framework, which was developed in HTML and JQuery is a bit simpler compared to others. These have a good resources and 
references like www.w3schools.com to learn and implement in my workspace. 

e) The other components other than client and server which were included were, heroku server. This is used to deploy my weblink. 

f) This application was deployed and run in heroku server. The commands used to run these were 
	1) git add .
	2) git commit - m “comment”
	3) git push heroic master
